def load_model(file_name = "models/distance_model/similar_ingredients/all_ingredients.json"):
    '''
    This function loads the similar ingredients model. It uses Google News word2vec embeddings to find similar ingredients. Note that it should take a few seconds to load the model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_name : str
        The name of the JSON file that contains valid ingredients. The default value is the absolute path to "all_ingredients.json".

    Returns
    -------
    function
        A function that takes in an ingredient and returns a list of similar ingredients.
        
    Notes
    -----
    The file all_ingredients.json contains a list of all valid ingredients. This is needed because the word embeddings may suggest words that are not food items.
